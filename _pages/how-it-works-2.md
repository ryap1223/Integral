<h4 style="text-align: justify;">8 Reasons to Outsource in the Philippines</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While India remains the top outsourcing location for IT services, the Asian region is continuing to make strong headway. Countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia have all proven to be exceptional locations for outsourcing; however, one of the countries making the most headway has consistently been the Philippines. The Philippine information technology and business process management (IT-BPM) industry, has become one of the country’s most dynamic industries and is now the Philippines’ second largest contributor to GDP.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Already serving companies in North America, Canada, Asia-Pacific and the EU, the Philippines is rapidly becoming the BPO destination of choice. Here are a number of factors that have contributed to its success:</p>

<h6 style="text-align: justify;">1. Economic growth</h6>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a strong affinity between the United States and the Philippines. There is also alignment in governments, and the regulatory environment is conducive to growth. Therefore, the Philippines is an ideal location from an economic perspective. Low labor costs provide an opportunity for organizations to provide customer-facing services at very attractive rates, while still providing that high level of quality customer care that providers are looking for.</p>

<h6 style="text-align: justify;">2. Talent</h6>
The Philippines workforce has a unique edge over most major worldwide markets in terms of labor quality. In anticipation of sustained industry growth, the Philippine government has implemented a series of initiatives to support talent development in BPO. For example, as part of the government’s Industry Public-Private Partnership Initiative, universities in the Philippines have now begun creating BPO-specific curriculum. As a result, more than 90% of BPO’s workforce are college graduates, with degrees in IT, communications, business and sciences.

This enables companies to outsource everything from customer care to skilled technical services, such as engineering, architecture and software development. The Philippines now has the third largest talent pool among the world’s greatest BPO service centers after India and China and is now considered a middle-class profession within the country.
<h6>3. Readily Available Workforce</h6>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Compared to other prominent outsourcing locations, the Philippines has a high number of accessible, highly-skilled employees to accommodate any underlying business need. Each year, the Philippines has hundreds of thousands of new college graduates who are eager to enter the BPO workforce.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Philippines has a reputation for long standing relationships with their hires and having a readily available workforce at their fingertips.</p>

<h6 style="text-align: justify;">4. Cost Savings</h6>
The cost differentiation between salaries, benefits and operational overhead all are major components that make the Philippines so appealing to businesses. It is estimated that the salary of a contact center agent in Philippines is between 14-20% of their Western counterparts. On top of dramatic labor-related cost savings, commercial property and infrastructure is significantly cheaper and subsidies and tax breaks further reduce costs.
<h6>5. Language</h6>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Philippines is one of the largest Englishspeaking countries in the world with the official languages being Filipino (Tagalog) and English. The people are also known for their neutral accents with the English language, making the region even more appealing for customer service providers. Many analysts also recognize the Philippines as the most westernized of the Asian markets and has been ranked number one globally in terms of quality of English and Western cultural affinity.</p>

<h6 style="text-align: justify;">6. Technology</h6>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Contact centers in the Philippines are some of the most innovative in the industry, and have been early adopters of a range of technologies such as IP telephony and social media, in order to communicate with their customers. Taking an omnichannel approach is another strategic advantage for the region, which is expected to be offering email, real-time chat, social media and video chat for all customer service interactions.For example, according to socialbakers, who track social activity, the Philippines is now Facebook’s eighth-largest market. The Philippines now ranks second in non-voice complex services globally</p>

<h6 style="text-align: justify;">7. Cross-sector Experience</h6>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As it has grown, the BPO industry in the Philippines has diversified significantly in breadth and scale. It now delivers services in a wide range of sectors and industries, including engineering, health care, legal, financial, creative, and software services, as well as for the energy, banking, investment, insurance and shipping industries. By vertical, banking and financial services, communications, government, technology, retail, and travel and transportation continue to be the largest consumers of BPO services in the Asia/Pacific region. With this wide range of industries also come more skilled and educated employees. With 95 percent of Filipino call center agents having a college degree, the variety of industries are only expected to grow and prosper in the coming years.</p>

<h6 style="text-align: justify;">8. Quality of Life</h6>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quality of life in the Philippines has drastically improved in recent years, with the country’s sustained economic growth and political stability. The government has been aggressively working on anti-corruption campaigns and has improved the investment grade of the Philippines in recent years. It not only hosts widespread transport, telecommunications and educational infrastructure, but also offers vibrant night life, world-class entertainment and a diverse natural environment.</p>

You could use an extra set of hands, so someone suggested that you should use a Virtual Assistant (VA). However, you have no idea what a VA is or for that matter, how they can help you. If that is the case, it is time for you step into the world of millennial workplace  and become<img class=" wp-image-175 alignright" src="http://integralva.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/clock-circle-300x300.png" alt="clock circle" width="139" height="139" /> virtual. A VA is a highly skilled professional who offers business support services virtually. This can consist of an individual or a team of virtual assistants with virtually meaning they are located off site and work remotely. They are independent contractors who specialize in providing an array of services such as administrative, creative, technical, and legal support. VAs, shouldn’t be confused with digital personal assistants like Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa or Cortana of Microsoft.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">We at Integral Solutions we will add your business to the growing trend of those VAs.  We recommend every entrepreneur to create a Lists to Freedom Solutions for immense entrepreneurial success.

<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-size: 18pt;">• </span>Things you shouldn’t be doing.
</span></p>
<span style="color: #000000;">The first item is very simple: <u>write down what you dislike doing in your business on a day-to-day basis</u>. This could
be anything from bookkeeping to administration.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">The second thing are <u>daily elements of the company you don’t have any experience in</u>, which could consist of social media marketing to graphic designing to document transcription.<img class="wp-image-187 alignright" src="http://integralva.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/email-Circle-300x300.png" alt="email Circle" width="165" height="165" /></span>
